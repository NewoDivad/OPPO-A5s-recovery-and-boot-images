# OPPO-A5s-recovery-and-boot-images
These are recovery and boot images extracted from OPPO A5s CPH1909.


You can use it freely but please tell me your accomplishments with these.
The boot image i successfully patched using magisk. the patched image is also in the repo.
Please tell me if you have used it successfully. 

How did I get these?
OPPO A5s is a mediatek based device so temporary root using mtk-su is possible. After rooting, I backed up the two images and that is what I am sharing with you right now.
I am not liable for any damages you do to your devices with these images. I just felt I have to share these because OPPO isn't going to provide you with these. Thanks
